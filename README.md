# Google Sheets Resume

This project was created using Google Sheets converted to an API using a Google Apps Script and React.
I currently keep a version of my resume as 6 different sheets

1. ContactMethods
2. Education
3. Experience
4. Bio
5. Skills
6. Site

For each row I add into these sheets they will update my site having it act as a running visual resume.
The page Site is used to explain this project on that page.

# Front End

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It uses FontAwesome Icons and Intersection Observer.
The html and css are taken from a template by [Template Foundation](https://www.templatefoundation.com/previews/miller/index.html)
I removed the JavaScript and reformatted the template into a react application

# Back End

I just go update my google sheets, the mock endpoints are GET/read-only.
I guess you claim the back-end is cloud hosted and NO-SQL but not in the way most people are using those words.
